--TODO: This file will generate Haskell expressions as Strings,
--give information about used functions, typeclasses etc and then
--expect the candidate to tell whether the given expression typechecks.
--it seems like a good idea to weight test cases so that non-type-checking
--tests have less of an impact.
--The function should be applicable to expression first and foremost,
--though it would be beneficial to also enable checking of whole functions
--the returned fitness value should establish a viable, learnable slope
